            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              When we build a site for a partner&apos;s client, we use the information to build and maintain
              that site. By default the partner is the client&apos;s point of contact. If the partner chooses the
              web-team option, we also communicate with the client by email about their site, from an address on the
              partner&apos;s domain. Partners are responsible for having any consents they need from their clients.

              We do not sell personal information. We share it with service providers for hosting, email, forms,
              invoicing and payments, and analytics only as needed, and when the law requires.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              We may use image-editing and image-generation tools, including AI-assisted tools, from third-party
              providers to prepare images for a website. We send only the images needed.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Contact-form messages on sites we build go through the client&apos;s own EmailJS account and do not pass
              through our systems.

              We keep information as long as needed for these purposes. After a site is cancelled we keep a backup
              for 45 days, then remove the client&apos;s identifying content from our retained copy, except records
              we must keep for legal or billing reasons. Files uploaded through an intake form are stored privately
              and deleted about 90 days after launch.
